Process to generate D8 grid

All processing has been within a Python 3.6 environment. D8 flow directions were found using flow routing tools from the Landlab landscape modeling package (http://landlab.github.io/#/).

1. The starting DEM was extracted from a grid with percentiles at 1/200 degrees resolution produced by Albert Van Dijk (/g/data/xc0/project/OzWALD2019/static/input grids/hypsometry.nc). The 0% percentile layer was used.
2. This grid then had a minimum filter passed over it using a 3 x 3 rectangular window.
3. The resulting grid from step 2 was resampled to 1/100 using bilinear interpolation.
4. A 1/100 D8 grid was then produced from the interpolated grid.
5. Step 2 and 3 were then repeated on the 1/100 DEM grid to produce a 1/20 grid.
6. A 1/20 D8 grid was then produced from the interpolated grid.

All of the above steps are layed out in order in a jupyter notebook file along with the two grids.

The grids are encoded to match the standard D8 directions specified in the ArcGIS software:

E =  1
SE = 2
S =  4
SW = 8
W =  16
NW = 32
N =  64
NE = 128
Sink = -1

The data format is also set such that the D8 direction grids can be read directly into ArcGIS to run the flow accumulation tools.
